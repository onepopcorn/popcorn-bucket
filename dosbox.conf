#                       sbtype: Type of Sound Blaster to emulate. 'gb' is Game Blaster.
#                                 Possible values: sb1, sb2, sbpro1, sbpro2, sb16, sb16vibra, gb, ess688, ess1688, reveal_sc400, none.
#                       sbbase: The IO address of the Sound Blaster.
#                                 220h to 2E0h are for use with IBM PC Sound Blaster emulation.
#                                 D2h to DEh are for use with NEC PC-98 Sound Blaster 16 emulation.
#                                 Possible values: 220, 240, 260, 280, 2a0, 2c0, 2e0, d2, d4, d6, d8, da, dc, de.
#                          irq: The IRQ number of the Sound Blaster (usually 5 or 7, depending on the sound card type and the game).
#                                 Set to 0 for the default setting of the sound card, or set to -1 to start DOSBox-X with the IRQ unassigned.
#                                 Possible values: 7, 5, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 0, -1.
#   listen to recording source: When the guest records audio from the Sound Blaster card, send the input source to the speakers as well so it can be heard.
#             recording source: Audio source to use when guest is recording audio. At this time only generated audio sources are available.
#                                 Possible values: silence, hiss, 1khz tone.
#                          dma: The DMA number of the Sound Blaster. Set to -1 to start DOSBox-X with the DMA unassigned.
#                                 Possible values: 1, 5, 0, 3, 6, 7, -1.
#                         hdma: The High DMA number of the Sound Blaster. Set to -1 to start DOSBox-X with the High DMA unassigned.
#                                 Possible values: 1, 5, 0, 3, 6, 7, -1.
#               enable speaker: Start the DOS virtual machine with the Sound Blaster speaker enabled.
#                                 Sound Blaster Pro and older cards have a speaker disable/enable command.
#                                 Normally the card boots up with the speaker disabled. If a DOS game or demo
#                                 attempts to play without enabling the speaker, set this option to true to
#                                 compensate. This setting has no meaning if emulating a Sound Blaster 16 card.
#                      sbmixer: Allow the Sound Blaster mixer to modify the DOSBox-X mixer.
#                      oplmode: Type of OPL emulation. On 'auto' the mode is determined by the 'sbtype' setting.
#                                 All OPL modes are AdLib-compatible, except for 'cms' (set 'sbtype=none' with 'cms' for a Game Blaster).
#                                 Possible values: auto, cms, opl2, dualopl2, opl3, opl3gold, none, hardware, hardwaregb, esfm.
#                       oplemu: Provider for the OPL emulation. 'compat' might provide better quality.
#                                 'nuked' is the most accurate (but the most CPU-intensive). See oplrate as well.
#                                 Possible values: default, compat, fast, nuked, mame, opl2board, opl3duoboard, retrowave_opl3, esfmu.
#                      oplrate: Sample rate of OPL music emulation. Use 49716 for highest quality (set the mixer rate accordingly).
#                                 Possible values: 49716, 48000, 44100, 32000, 22050, 16000, 11025, 8000.
#                      oplport: Serial port of the OPL2 Audio Board when oplemu=opl2board, opl2mode will become 'opl2' automatically.
#                retrowave_bus: Bus of the Retrowave series board (serial/spi). SPI is only supported on Linux.
#               retrowave_port: Serial port of the Retrowave series board.
#                 hardwarebase: base address of the real hardware Sound Blaster:
#                                 210,220,230,240,250,260,280
